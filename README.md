This is an auxiliary tool that lists every Magic the Gathering card with a dog reference.

## features

* Change the fetch request on `lib/loadCards` to easily change the listed cards.
* It uses some `print:` classes from the Tailwind CSS to print better proxies and use less ink.
* If the card has Full Art, Promo, Reprint, or Variation prints available it shows a tag on the upper right side.
